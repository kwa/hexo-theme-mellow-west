hexo-theme-mellow-west
======================

## The repo is a copy/fork of [https://github.com/codefine/hexo-theme-mellow](https://github.com/codefine/hexo-theme-mellow) 
go there for the original (and 'latest' version)

## Why a copy/fork?
I wanted to try out this theme but saw that most of the information was written in Chinese (I do not read Chinese),
so I used Google translate to translate everything into English.

I have not spent a lot of time looking over the translations which are not visible (like comments in code),
so you can probably come up with better translations.

## Have I changed anything from the original?
Besides the translations, I have mostly added config keys for texts in various places.

Some keys are enable/disable kind of keys and some are translation keys which I have created.

There may be a few places left which do have translation keys but they should all be translated into English.
